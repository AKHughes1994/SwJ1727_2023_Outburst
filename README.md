# Description

This repo hosts the comprehensive radio light curves of the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. The data were assembled and presented in Hughes et al. in prep. As of Feb 2025, the data include 217 epochs from 7 facilities, with frequencies ranging from 0.3-300 GHz. 

This is a reasonably simple repo. The main components are: 

1. The radio data (in CSV format) are found in `files/SWJ1727_Radio.csv`
2. The plotting and analysis scripts are included in the included notebook
3. The MAXI/GSC X-ray data needed to create the Hardness-Intensity diagram are also included in `files`


This repo may be updated once we finish the Radio-X-ray luminosity correlation analysis.
