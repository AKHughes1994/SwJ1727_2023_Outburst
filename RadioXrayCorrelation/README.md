# Radio:Xray Correlation Subdirectory

This subdirectory contains data and scripts related to the analysis of the radio/X-ray correlation for the 2023-2024 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. 
The methodology and data are associated with the following paper:

TBA

## Directory Contents

- `SWJ1717_LRLX_Notebook.ipynb`  
  Main Jupyter notebook for the analysis of the radio (Lr) and X-ray (Lx) luminosity correlation for Swift J1727.8-1613. Includes data loading, processing, interpolation, plotting, and model fitting.

### Folders

- `LrLx_Catalog_Files/`  
  Contains reference catalogs and tabulated data used for Lrâ€“Lx correlation studies, possibly including literature samples for comparison.

- `SWJ1717_Files/`  
  Raw and processed data products specific to Swift J1727.8-1613, such as light curves, flux measurements, and intermediate files generated during the analysis.

- `plots/`  
  Output directory for plots and figures generated by the analysis scripts and notebooks.

- `xray_analysis/`  
  Scripts and data related to the reduction and analysis of X-ray observations.

- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`  
  Jupyter Notebook internal checkpoints for autosave/recovery (can be ignored by most users).

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python (>=3.8) and the required packages (see the top of the main notebook for a list).
2. Open and run `SWJ1717_LRLX_Notebook.ipynb` for a step-by-step, reproducible workflow.
3. Intermediate and output data will be saved to the appropriate folders.

## Notes

- All data and scripts are intended for reproducible scientific analysis.
- Please cite the forthcoming paper when using these data or scripts.
